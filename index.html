        <h3>FIND THE PEACE <small> • Autumn in Japan</small></h3>

        <p>Autumn season is one of the beautiful seasons that you can discover its absolute beauty in Japan. The viewing of Autumn leaves is called momijigari in Japanese. From mid-September until the beginning of November, Japan’s deciduous trees begin to change colour, painting mountains, parks and forests with a vibrant palette of reds, brown, oranges, golds and yellows. You can feel the autumn atmosphere in different places from Mid October to Early December except Hokkaido region. Though some part of Kanto and Chubu regions provide plenty of incredible fall colors in early October.</p>

        <h3>東京, Tōkyō <small> • Sci-fi Cityscapes</small></h3>

        <p>Tokyo's neon-lit streetscapes still look like a sci-fi film set – and that's a vision of the city from the 1980s. Tokyo has been building ever since, pushing the boundaries of what's possible on densely populated, earthquake-prone land, adding ever taller, sleeker structures. Come see the utopian mega-malls, the edgy designer boutiques from Japan's award-winning architects, and the world's tallest tower – Tokyo Sky Tree – a twisting spire that draws on ancient building techniques. Stand atop one of Tokyo's skyscrapers and look out over the city at night to see it blinking like the control panel of a starship, stretching all the way to the horizon.</p>

        <h3>FOOD MEANS TRADITION <small> • Eat Your Heart Out</small></h3>

        <p>Yes, Tokyo has more Michelin stars than any other city. Yes, Japanese cuisine has been added to the Unesco Intangible Cultural Heritage list. But that's not what makes dining in Tokyo such an amazing experience. What really counts is the city's long-standing artisan culture. You can splash out on the best sushi of your life, made by one of the city's legendary chefs using the freshest, seasonal market ingredients. You can also spend ¥800 on a bowl of noodles made with the same care and exacting attention to detail, from a recipe honed through decades of experience.</p>
